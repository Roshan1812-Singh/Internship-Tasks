                    "The Long Walk to Freedom" is the title of Nelson Mandela's autobiography, recounting his life from
                    childhood through his presidency in South Africa. The book details his journey fighting against
                    apartheid, his imprisonment, and his eventual triumph in leading the country towards democracy. It's
                    a story of resilience, leadership, and the fight for equality and freedom.
